            <h3>Art by MingTxm</h3>
            <p>This was a high school group project done on replit that showcases the digital artwork of MingTxm (one of
                the group members), featuring portraits of athletes and musicians. The website provides an online
                gallery for the artwork, as well as commission services for personalized portraits, although there is no
                actual back-end implementation. There are also a few made-up reviews at the bottom of the home page.</p>
